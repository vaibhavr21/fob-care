# FOB Care

FOB Care is an innovative web platform designed to enhance the safety and accessibility of Foot Over Bridges (FOBs) in urban environments. By providing a simple and efficient way for citizens to report issues and suggest improvements, FOB Care aims to ensure safer pedestrian movement across busy roads and railway tracks.

## Features
- **Report Issues**: Users can report problems related to cleanliness, lighting, safety, and accessibility of FOBs directly through the platform.
- **Make Suggestions**: A feature that allows citizens to provide suggestions for improvements, helping to create better infrastructure.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with simplicity in mind, making it easy for everyone to navigate and contribute to enhancing their local FOBs.

## Purpose
FOBs are vital infrastructure that ensures the safety of pedestrians crossing busy areas. However, they often face issues such as poor lighting, maintenance problems, and accessibility concerns. FOB Care connects citizens with authorities to resolve these issues and improve the overall safety and convenience of these crucial pedestrian pathways.

## How It Works
1. **Report an Issue**: If you notice any problem with a nearby FOB, simply report it through the platform, detailing the problem and its location.
2. **Suggestions for Improvement**: Share your ideas on how FOBs can be made more accessible or safer for all users.
3. **Engagement with Authorities**: The reports and suggestions are directed to the relevant authorities, who can then take the necessary actions to improve the infrastructure.

## Contribute to Safer Cities
By actively participating in reporting issues and making suggestions, you play a critical role in improving urban mobility and ensuring that FOBs are safe, clean, and accessible for everyone.
